# Near Node Flash Element Controller

NNF-EC provides control and monitoring of Near Node Flash hardware through various Redfish/Swordfish endpoints.

For interacting with NNF hardware, refer to the [internal/switchtec](./internal/switchtec/) directory. Hardware functions are typically matched with a corresponding CLI command for testing.

A variety of managers exist for interacting with hardware through Redfish/Swordfish HTTP endpoints:

- The [NNF Manager](./pkg/manager-nnf/) is used to provision storage, map storage to particular nodes, and layout file systems.
- The [Fabric Manager](./pkg/manager-fabric/) and [NVMe Manager](./pkg/manager-nvme/) exist to support the NNF Manager and provides finer visibility and control of underlying hardware.
- The [Event Manager](./pkg/manager-event/) and [Telemetry Manager](./pkg/manager-telemetry/) provide visibility into NNF happenings.
- The [Message Registry](./pkg/manager-message-registry/) defines the event messages generated by NNF software
- The [Server Manager](./pkg/manager-server/) provides controls for managing a server node, including discovering attached storage and establishing a file system.

A number of [interactive scripts](./scripts/) exist to exercise functionality manually on a running system
